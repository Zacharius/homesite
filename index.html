      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Havabol : an interpreted, functional programming language</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Semester Long project for a senior level course on Compilers</li>
          <li>Built with Java, supports 5 weakly typed data types, arrays, structs
            , infix expressions, flow control, and user defined expressions.</li>
          <li>Working on a team of three, this project gave me a strong
              understanding of the software development process as we had to
              deliver a functional prototype of Havabol with certain capabilities
              throughout the course.</li>
          <li>Used JUnit to create hundreds of test cases to ensure that all
            features of the language was fully functioning and to ensure new
            features did not break old ones</li>
        </ul>


      <h3>SMA: A secure messaging app for Android</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Working on a team of five, I was given the role of scrum master and
            led the team over the length of a semester.</li>
          <li>Built within Android Studio, using an XML frontend and Java backend</li>
          <li>All messages encrypted with asymmetrical keys</li>
          <li>Also involved building a server which all messages would pass
              through and which stored the public keys for all registered users</li>
          <li>API between app and server worked by passing JSON strings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>TrumpTalk: A Twiter sentiment analysis tool</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Project for RowdyHacks 2017, the UTSA Hackathon, for which we won
              2nd place</li>
          <li>Collected  then President Elect Donald Trump's last 100 tweets,
              along with a thousand replies per tweet.</li>
          <li>Used Google's cloud Platform sentiment analysis engine to score
              each Tweet and their replies on a scale from -1,extremely positive,
              to 1, extremely positive</li>
          <li>Used this database to examine how public sentiment to Trump has
              changed over time, how the sentiment of his tweets had changed,
              and how public response would be differ depending on the sentiment
              of a tweet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

            <li>Description:<br>
              I was put in charge of the TUM project. The idea of the project
              was to have a central server which would serve as a key repository
              for a business or group of people, which could only be used if you
              were within physical proximity of the server. Members of the group
              would have the client app installed on their mobile devices as well
              as apps that utilized the “TUM ecosystem” as we called it. All the
              user info on these apps were encrypted and the keys to decrypt
              the data was stored only on the TUM server.</li>
            <h3>Responsibilites</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Implement and coordinate the API calls between the client and
                  server</li>
                <li>Improve the reliability of the Bluetooth connection between

                <li>Build an SMS application which would utilize the TUM
                  client/server and serve as a usecase for the TUM ecosystem</li>
                <li>The project was presented at the 2016 Cyber Security Small
                  Business Innovative Research Workshop</li>

        <h3>University of Texas at San Antonio</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Role: Computer Science Tutor</li>
          <li>Description:<br>
            While I was a student at UTSA, my impressive grades and knowledge
            alllowed me the opportunity of being a tutor in the Computer Science
            Lab. I was available for certain times throughout the day to students
            struggling with their computer science courses. They would come to
            me and the othe tutors and whoever was available and had the most
            experience in the given topic would help that student with their
            class. We would generally either explain CS topics or help students
            diagnose a bug in their program, usually both. This could be
            especially difficult because students would often want to be given
            the solution rather than the knowledge to solve it for themselves.
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>Assisted students having difficulty in CS classes</li>
